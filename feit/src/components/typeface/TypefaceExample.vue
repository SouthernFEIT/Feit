      <p>About FEIT</p>

      <p>
        The faculty of Engineering and Information Technology (FEIT) is a faculty within the Southern University College (Southern UC). It was established on August 12, 2012 after Southern College (SC) was upgraded to Southern UC. The history reaches back to two decades ago, when the Department of Computer Science was first established in 1991, followed by the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering in 2004. These two departments were then integrated and renamed as the School of Engineering and Information Technology (SEIT) in March 2006.

        Nestled in the intricate beauty of lush greeneries and foliage, the faculty is on the second floor of Southern UCâ€™s main building. Currently, the faculty has 40% of the teaching staff who are Ph.D holders specializing in different fields of studies.

        With experienced and highly qualified teaching staff and state of the art facilities in the faculty, the diplomas and degree programs offered are accredited by the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA) or recognized by the Engineering Accreditation Council Malaysia (EAC).
